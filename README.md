# logic_final_project

Hello! This is the final project for Logic and Computation Spring 2021.

The file within this repository is the implementation of a Z3 SMT solver using Python. 
It is used to solve the Thinkominos puzzle: http://www.virtualtoychest.com/p/puzzles/thinkominos/thinkominos.html

Our first attempt at this solver is shown in project.py but it was later scrapped 

The current / final version of the solver is in bestVersion.py
