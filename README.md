# logic_final_project

Hello! This is the final project for Logic and Computation Spring 2021.

The file within this repository is the implementation of a Z3 SMT solver using Python. 
It is used to solve the Thinkominos puzzle: http://www.virtualtoychest.com/p/puzzles/thinkominos/thinkominos.html

Our first attempt at this solver is shown in attempt1.py but it was later scrapped 

Next, we tried another implementation but it turned out to be ooverly complicated, and is shown in attempt2.py

The current / final version of the solver is in finalAttempt.py
