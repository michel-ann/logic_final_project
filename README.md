# logic_final_project

Hello! This is the final project for Logic and Computation Spring 2021.

The file within this repository is the implementation of a Z3 SMT solver using Python. 
It is used to solve the Thinkominos puzzle: http://www.virtualtoychest.com/p/puzzles/thinkominos/thinkominos.html

So far, it is almost completed, except for adding the instance in which the solver will work with. Other than that,
all of the conditions and variables have been defined within the file.
